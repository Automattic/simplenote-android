* Taking notes in Urdu, Arabic, or… Aramaic? We’ve introduced support and layouts for right-to-left languages!
* Open any note in the app from the home screen with a new note list widget.
* We’ve added a new toolbar to find matching terms within notes, and the option to search your tags list.
* The note widget on your home screen is now available in dark mode, too.
* We smoothed out searches in notes that contain checklists, and shooed off an issue that caused a lag while editing.
