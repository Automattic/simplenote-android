A Simplenote client for Android. Learn more about Simplenote at [Simplenote.com](https://simplenote.com).

## Development Requirements
* A Simperium account. [Sign up here](https://simperium.com/signup/)
* A Simperium Application ID and key. [Create a new app here](https://simperium.com/app/new/)

## How to Configure

1) Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Automattic/simplenote-android.git
cd simplenote-android
```

2) Import into Android Studio using the "Gradle" build option. You may need to create a `local.properties` file with the absolute path to the Android SDK:

Sample `local.properties`
```
sdk.dir=/Applications/Android Studio.app/sdk
```

3) Simperium Config

Add your simperium appid and key to Simplenote/gradle.properties, and an empty googleAnalyticsId:

```
simperiumAppId=SIMPERIUM_APP_ID
simperiumAppKey=SIMPERIUM_KEY
googleAnalyticsId=
```

4) Install debug build with Android Studio or `./gradlew installDebug`

_Note: Simplenote API features such as sharing and publishing will not work with development builds._

## Android Wear

To properly install the wear app, run `./gradlew assembleRelease` to package up the app and then `adb install` with the generated .apk to the host device.

If you want to debug the Wear app, simply connect the device to adb and then run the `Wear` project from Android Studio.
